## Abstract
This project aims to conduct a 3D visibility analysis of the Pinakes at the Heraion of Olympia, using the open-source software Blender and QGIS. The project builds on previous work by other researchers on the Pinakes at the site, and aims to use the 3D model to better understand the visibility of the Pinakes from different viewpoints near the temple. The results will be visualized using raster maps for better understanding of the function of the Pinakes in the context of the Heraion.

## Methods
The project was worked on over 10 weeks, with each week dedicated to a specific task such as creating a new reconstruction model, setting up a simulation environment and performing simulations in Blender, and data analysis in QGIS. The project used various tools and technologies such as Blender, QGIS, and Python scripts to complete the project.

## Data
The project uses data from previous research on the Pinakes (provided by Dr. Sieverling) and a photogrammetry model provided by Dr. Sapirstein. The data was used to create a 3D reconstruction of the temple and its surrounding area, and also used to perform simulations and data analysis.

## Results
The project results in a 3D model of the Heraion and its surrounding area, as well as raster maps that visualize the visibility of the Pinakes from different viewpoints in the temple.

## Conclusion
The project makes a contribution to the field by providing a better understanding of the function of the Pinakes in the context of the Heraion. It also provides a way to conduct visibility analysis using only free and open-source software.
