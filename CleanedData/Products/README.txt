3D Models:
> Rekonstruction:
Contains the .blend file for the reconstruction, an .obj/.mtl version and also a render of the temple.
The reconstruction is incomplete in its current form, as the time for the project sadly ran out.
A finished version might be added at later time - time permitting.
 
> Simulation:
Contains the .blend file for the reconstruction and an .obj/.mtl version.
The simulation contains a geometrically simpler Heraion, so that its render time stays short, but also having no loss of information concerning the research question.
It also has the Python script saved under the script tab and can be run from the 'Scripting' tab (Will not be available in the .obj file).

Maps:
> OstX / S端dX / WestX:
Contain the viewshed of every single pinax, of all the pinakes of single columns 
and also the viewshed of all the pinakes summed together overlayed ontop of the Heraion plan and its immediate surroundings.
Can be considered the final visualisation of the project.

Raster:
> OstX / S端dX / WestX:
Contain the viewsheds of all the pinakes.

Renders:
> OstX / S端dX / WestX:
Contain the rendered images generated from the simulation blend file. Black and white images only, as they are the calculation of the viewshed from every position to the pinakes.

Reports:
> OstX / S端dX / WestX:
Contain the statistical reports generated through QGIS from the rendered images.
